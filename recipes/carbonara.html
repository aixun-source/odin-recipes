        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is one of my favourite Western dishes. Since we started out with lasagna, I was trying to come up with other pastas that I liked, but I couldn't really come up with anything. Aglio Olio is a little to oily for me, and most pastas are unappealing as I usually just throw it in some water and wait for it to boil.</p>
        <p>Carbonara however is rich in cheese, which I love slurping down. Pair it in a set meal with ice lemon tea, and it becomes even better, as the ice lemon tea offsets the heaviness of the cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>And other ingredients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add bacon and water to a skillet and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Continue simmering until water is evaporated, then continue to cook the bacon until crispy.</li>
            <li>And other steps.</li>
        </ol>
