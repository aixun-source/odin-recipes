        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was taken from the epicurious website, and the article was written by -</p>
        <p>Actually, I don't know since epicurious wants me to subscribe and I don't want to. Therefore, I will be switching the website to BA, or Bon Appetit. Unfortunately, they too want me to subscribe, so I am switching again. And I have settled on NYT cooking.</p>
        <p>They have an article on lasagna written by Regina Schrambling, and it was apparently done in 2001. I mean good food doesn't change no matter how old the recipe is.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 medium red onions, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 large cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>8 ounces of pancetta, diced</li>
            <li>...and plenty of other ingredients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce, heat Â½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</li>
            <li>...and plenty of other steps.</li>
